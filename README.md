# BikeSharing_Project

# Goal:
Develop a model to find the variables that are significant in the demand for shared bikes with the available independent variables and report appropriate metrics of your model evaluation.
# Outcome:
The variables that are significant in predicting the demand for shared bikes (at least 3).

Note:  cnt is the dependent variable

# About Data
There are 730 rows and 16 columns in the data set. There are no null values in any of the columns.
# Interepretation of results
Analysing the above model, the comapany should focus on the following features:

Company should focus on expanding business during Spring.
Company should focus on expanding business during September.
Based on previous data it is expected to have a boom in number of users once situation comes back to normal, compared to 2019.
There would be less bookings during Light Snow or Rain, they could probably use this time to serive the bikes without having business impact.

Hence when the situation comes back to normal, the company should come up with new offers during spring when the weather is pleasant and also advertise a little for September as this is when business would be at its best.
# Conclusion
Significant variables to predict the demand for shared bikes

    * holiday
    * temp
    * hum
    * windspeed
    * Season
